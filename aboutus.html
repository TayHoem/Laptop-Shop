    <h1>Our company</h1>
    <p><br>It all started with a group of university students who struggle to buy their own laptop due to a limited budget.<br>
    Unfortunately, the laptops they got for themselves weren't exactly what they desired.
    They were all taken advantage of by greedy laptop resellers who sold them laptops that were not usable for assignments with an unreasonable price.<br>
    Therefore, years later, they came up with an idea to form an IT company that sells a wide range of laptops for students and business owners.</p>
    <br><br>

    <p>BITS isn't just like any laptop company. BITS collaborates with well-known companies in order to provide you a laptop with the best value and services.
    <br>BITS aims to provide students powerful laptops with lower value. As well as a trade-in discount for customers who are looking for a new laptop.
    Not only that, BITS provides you advice on picking the best laptop for yourself.</p>
   <br><br>

    <p>We believe our objective will help students with low income to buy affordable and sustainable laptops.
    Our service will focus on providing assistance to customers to choose the best laptops for their needs.</p>
